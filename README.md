**Product Requirements Document (PRD): Deno-based CI/CD Platform**

**1. Overview**
The Deno-based CI/CD Platform is a modern, lightweight continuous integration and delivery solution designed for developers leveraging the Deno runtime. This platform simplifies the development pipeline by executing build, test, and deployment workflows directly within a Deno environment, ensuring performance, security, and type safety.

**2. Objectives**
- Provide a secure and fast CI/CD solution for Deno-based projects.
- Simplify pipeline configuration with TypeScript-based scripting.
- Support integrations with popular source control platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Offer real-time feedback on build, test, and deployment statuses.

**3. Key Features**

**3.1 Pipeline Configuration**
- Use a `deno-pipeline.ts` file to define workflows.
- TypeScript API for defining stages (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- Built-in support for reusable pipeline templates.

**3.2 Source Control Integration**
- Webhooks to trigger pipelines on events like push, pull request, and merge.
- OAuth-based integration for repository access.
- Support for branch-specific workflows.

**3.3 Build and Test Automation**
- Execute Deno scripts for builds and tests.
- Support for caching dependencies between pipeline runs.
- Parallel and sequential task execution.

**3.4 Deployment**
- Integrate with major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and custom servers.
- Rollback support for failed deployments.
- Canary and blue-green deployment strategies.

**3.5 Real-Time Feedback**
- Live logs for pipeline execution.
- Notifications via email, Slack, or other channels.
- Dashboard for viewing historical pipeline runs and statuses.

**3.6 Security and Access Control**
- Token-based authentication for API access.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for team management.
- Secure execution environment with sandboxing.

**3.7 Extensibility**
- Plugin architecture for custom tasks and integrations.
- Marketplace for community-contributed plugins.

**4. Technical Requirements**

**4.1 Core Technologies**
- Deno runtime for executing scripts and workflows.
- TypeScript for pipeline scripting and platform logic.
- WebSockets for real-time updates.
- PostgreSQL for storing pipeline configurations and logs.

**4.2 Scalability**
- Stateless worker nodes for horizontal scaling.
- Load balancing for API and worker nodes.
- Caching mechanisms for dependencies and results.

**4.3 Deployment**
- Containerized deployment using Docker.
- Support for Kubernetes-based orchestration.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for repeatable deployments.

**5. User Roles and Permissions**
- **Administrator**: Full control over the platform, including user and resource management.
- **Developer**: Create and manage pipelines for their projects.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to pipeline results and logs.

**6. User Interface Requirements**

**6.1 Dashboard**
- Overview of all projects and pipelines.
- Graphical representation of pipeline execution (e.g., Gantt chart).

**6.2 Pipeline Editor**
- Code editor for `deno-pipeline.ts` files with TypeScript IntelliSense.
- Validation for syntax and configuration errors.

**6.3 Logs and Metrics**
- Searchable, filterable logs for each pipeline run.
- Metrics for build/test success rates, average execution times, etc.

**6.4 Notifications**
- Configurable notifications for pipeline events.
- Integration with third-party notification systems.

**7. Non-Functional Requirements**
- High availability with a 99.9% uptime SLA.
- Latency under 100ms for API responses.
- Support for at least 10,000 pipelines per day.

**8. Roadmap**

**Phase 1: MVP**
- Basic pipeline execution with `deno-pipeline.ts`.
- GitHub integration.
- Build and test automation.

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Support for multiple source control platforms.
- Advanced deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary).
- Role-based access control.

**Phase 3: Extensibility and Scaling**
- Plugin marketplace.
- Horizontal scaling for large organizations.
- Enhanced metrics and reporting tools.

**9. Success Metrics**
- Adoption by 1,000+ developers within the first year.
- Execution of 50,000+ pipelines within the first six months.
- Average pipeline execution time under 5 minutes.

**10. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk                              | Mitigation                               |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| High initial complexity for users | Provide detailed documentation and tutorials. |
| Scalability issues with demand    | Design with a scalable, containerized architecture. |
| Security vulnerabilities          | Regular audits and use of sandboxing.   |

**11. Appendix**
- Sample `deno-pipeline.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Pipeline } from "deno-ci";

const pipeline = new Pipeline();

pipeline.stage("Build", async () => {
  await Deno.run({ cmd: ["deno", "bundle", "main.ts"] }).status();
});

pipeline.stage("Test", async () => {
  await Deno.run({ cmd: ["deno", "test"] }).status();
});

pipeline.stage("Deploy", async () => {
  await Deno.run({ cmd: ["deploy-script.sh"] }).status();
});

export default pipeline;
```
